Please DO NOT use this code in production!

This is an early research prototype built exclusively for benchmarking purposes
and it may be riddled with obvious security vulnerabilities. In the future, if
this code gets the level of scrutiny that security-critical production code
deserves, I will remove this warning. Until then, here be dragons.

This is a protoype of a new space-hard hash function construction.
